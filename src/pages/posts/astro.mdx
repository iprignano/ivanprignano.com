I've probably built 3 or 4 incarnations of this website since its previous version went last online. All of them were built with different technologies – it was a perfect excuse for me to experiment with new frameworks or libraries that I was interested in: the small scope helped me to stay focused on getting the basics down and allowed me to have some fun playing around with the styling.

None of those experiments produced anything particularly satisfying for me, so I never published those. There are several reasons for that (I've recently read about "perfectionist procrastination"), but oftentimes I felt like I was fighting the technology more than I wanted; I never got in the state where I could just _enjoy_ my time building the thing. After all, this is an extremely simple website – spending time trying to handle the technologic overhead for a portfolio website felt like a real vibe killer.

Unlike the other frameworks I've tried, **[Astro](https://astro.build) clicked right away for me**: the abstractions made sense, the tradeoffs seemed sensible, the tooling was a breeze to use and – most importantly – the documentation was great.

I'm sure there's plenty of literature about how Astro compares to other similar frameworks, its pitfalls and how well (or not) it can scale past a simple portfolio website; but today I'm grateful for it because it helped me to finally publish a new personal website that I enjoyed building – and that I don't hate.
